A docstring is[] provided for each of the functions. Figure out what they’re supposed to do, and then
implement them! Suggestion: do them in the order listed. Once you’ve written count_freq, try looking
at the frequencies of some common words, like 'the' and 'hamlet'. (Try comparing 'honour' and
'happiness'.) If there’s a piece of terminology or math that you’re not sure about, feel free to ask
a classmate or an instructor.
While in the last lab you probably wrote code conventionally, using procedures familiar from C and Java
(like for loops), now you have the tools to implement some similar methods the Pythonic way. You can
do each of these the “brute force” way, but it’s much more efficient to use Python’s builtins. With these,
you can write some of these functions in a single line! A question to consider: what tasks can and can’t
you do with builtins?
As you work, make sure to save the notebook occasionally. You’ll submit today’s lab next Tuesday in
class
